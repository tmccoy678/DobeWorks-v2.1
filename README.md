# DobeWorks v2.1

DobeWorks is a public development snapshot of a personal engineering system. This repository contains two runnable, standard-library Python demonstrations:

- **Observer Core** turns a bounded synthetic snapshot into a minimized status record and makes stale or unavailable evidence explicit.
- **Worker Core** validates a bounded synthetic job and stages its result without accepting or promoting it.

The examples use synthetic fixtures. They do not inspect a device, install a service, grant authority, or qualify a production system.

## Quick start

Python 3.9 or later is required. No package installation is needed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmccoy678/DobeWorks-v2.1.git
cd DobeWorks-v2.1
```

Run the Observer against the included fresh fixture:

```sh
python3 -B contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/observer_core.py \
  --snapshot contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/fixtures/observer-snapshot.json \
  --policy contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/fixtures/observer-policy.json \
  --allowed-input-root contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/fixtures \
  --now 2026-09-06T00:01:00Z
```

The result has `status: VALIDATED` and `freshness: FRESH`. Change `--now` to `2026-09-07T00:01:00Z` to see stale evidence become `TELEMETRY_UNAVAILABLE` with unknown signals.

Run one Worker job in a disposable directory:

```sh
demo_stage=$(mktemp -d)
python3 -B contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/worker_core.py \
  --envelope contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/fixtures/job-envelope.json \
  --input contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/fixtures/input-records.json \
  --staging-root "$demo_stage" \
  --allowed-input-root contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/fixtures \
  --configuration-sha256 ba0e803fc49b7a78989a44c9c9beb9789e37980b7ce92654a89d3f364460873d \
  --now 2026-09-06T00:01:00Z
```

The expected state is `COMPLETED_UNACCEPTED`. Inspect the staged files, then remove the disposable directory when finished. The [software-core guide](contexts/operational-system/software/phase4/README.md) explains the checks and limits.

## Tests

The ordinary public tests use only the checkout and Python standard library:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover \
  -s contexts/operational-system/software/phase4 -p 'test_*_core.py' -v
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s benchmarks -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The current suite contains 70 Worker/Observer tests and six benchmark tests. The benchmark exercises 318 public JSON inputs plus two native controls. These results cover the included synthetic behaviors; they do not prove security, correctness, device support, or production readiness.

Historical package-validator tests are separate. They use pinned Git history, and the Phase 4 set also needs the original external specification through `DOBEWORKS_PHASE4_SPEC`. A normal source archive does not contain that historical artifact. See [historical package tests](docs/historical-package-tests.md).

This is a development snapshot without a versioned release or universal platform-support claim. It was recorded on Apple silicon with macOS 26.6.2 and Python 3.9.6; the standard-library examples are intended to be portable, while other environments remain unverified.
